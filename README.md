## Mission Statement and Product Description

Gym interest, and the lengths people are willing to go to get great results, are both rising. However, improving muscle activation is often overlooked, leading the people who are able to stay consistent to sub-optimal results, and unbalanced physiques. We offer a solution to this problem, with our thermal-camera phone application named "TAct" - which stands for thermal activation. It is a non-invasive application that uses thermal imaging to estimate muscle activation, backed by science and as a data-driven solution.

It also provides a unified interfact for tracking gym progress.
